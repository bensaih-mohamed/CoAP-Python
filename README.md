# CoAP-Python
CoAP libraries for python 
in most of cases after the command # pip install coapthon.
if you are using python3, a compilation errors will be desplay when the programme is running.
therefore it is enough to replace the coap libraries installed with the previous command 
by the libraries coap and coap-info mentioned above.
